imagine-web
===========

Image catalog: make archives of photographs more accessible.

This is the web part of imagine, basically the gallery version.

As a (hobby) photographer, you might have years and many gigabytes of material
on your drives which you only rarely watch back. To make it more easy to find
certain pictures or just provide a fun trip down memory lane, use imagine to
make an overview of your archives.

The goal is not to import the images into a (new) archive and manage collections
from there, but to provide an easy-to-use overview of your work. This can even
be used standalone (think on a different machine with no access to your library).

imagine-web uses [imagine-core](https://github.com/aquatix/imagine-core), which
contains the models and other helper functionality. [imagine-crawler](https://github.com/aquatix/imagine-crawler)
is the archive creator/updater.
